          To keep the bot alive after you close your terminal:
          Start a named screen session

     screen -S uniform

Activate venv inside screen

     source uniform-bot/bin/activate

Change directory to the uniform-bot

     cd uniform-bot
     
Install Required Python Packages
     Run this command in your terminal or command prompt:
     
     pip install pillow discord.py
     

Packages explained:
     Pillow: Used for image generation and editing.
     discord.py: For interacting with Discord servers and member roles (if needed).
   
Launch the bot

     python bot.py

-----------------------------------------------

Detach from screen
     Press Ctrl-A then D.
     The bot remains running in the background.

Reattach to screen

Invite the bot to your discord server and add it to a channel that you wish for your members to be able to create their uniforms.  All images will be generated by the bot and then uploaded into this channel and then removed from the bot directory.
